"""What a probe returns, and how a declared probe name resolves to one.

docs/reference.md § The apparatus core can only observe and § The apparatus
files. A probe is a plain function, `probe(cfg) -> Apparatus`, registered the
same way a resolver is — `reference.md` § Creating a plugin — and `Apparatus`
is the one shape it may return.

    § The importable surface's row says "What a probe returns: facts", and a
    second field would be a surface no document describes.

    **Not validated here.** `Apparatus` is constructed inside the probe's own
    body, so a refusal raised in `__init__` would be indistinguishable from any
    other exception a probe's body raises. `Unit` is the shipped precedent for
    exactly this split: `Unit.__post_init__` validates nothing (it freezes
    `attributes` into a read-only view, which stops a caller from mutating a
    roster shared across every condition — a property this class does not
    need, since nothing downstream holds one `Apparatus` across two callers),
    and `units._from_resolver` is where a yielded non-`Unit` is refused, under
    `E-RESOLVER-YIELD`. The value contract for `facts` — `str` keys, scalar
    values — is enforced the same way, at core's boundary, once a probe has
    already returned. `frozen=True` stops `facts` from being *rebound*; the
    mapping it holds is not itself made read-only, unlike `Unit.attributes`.

    """The callable an `apparatus_probe` name resolves to, or the refusal that
    answers instead. `units._resolver_for`'s sibling, step for step:

    - **The name**, answered from package metadata alone (`scan_group`), so a
      name no installed distribution registers costs no import at all.
      `E-PROBE-UNKNOWN`, naming every member of the group it did find, because
      the ordinary cause is a spelling. `validate._check_probe` reports the
      same code from the same metadata scan; this function raises it at
      dispatch.
    - **The object**, through `load_entry_point`, the one function in `plugins`
      that calls `EntryPoint.load()`. Every way a plugin's top level can fail
      arrives as `E-PLUGIN-LOAD`, including `SystemExit`.
    - **The declaration against the key** (`check_registration` over
      `declared_names`), `E-PLUGIN-DECORATOR`.

    Two sources of truth exist for "is this probe registered" — the
    entry-point metadata scan above, and the `PROBES` mapping `register_probe`
    fills at import — and they are reconciled here rather than read from either
    alone: `PROBES` alone would resolve a decorator-only registration
    `validate` refused, and the metadata scan alone would resolve to an object
    never checked against its own declaration. `declared_names` is what
    reconciles them, giving `PROBES` its first reader.

    A collision between two distributions claiming this key is **not** decided
    here. `validate`'s own check reports `E-PLUGIN-COLLISION` over the
    complete claim set, from metadata, in name order — the first claimant is
    used here rather than re-deciding a tie, since a verdict computed twice is
    a verdict that can disagree with itself.
